        <div>
          <div>
            <p>
              YinYang Leadership began with a simple but powerful question: What
              if the real strength of a business lies in what we can’t measure
              on a spreadsheet?
            </p>
            <p>
              Our founder, Tanisha, spent over a decade partnering with leaders,
              teams, and organisations driven by big ambitions, rapid growth,
              and impressive results. However, an invisible thread ran through
              every success story and every setback: Culture is an intangible
              asset but its impact is anything but invisible.  This became the
              seed of YinYang Leadership. Inspired by the ancient philosophy
              that seemingly opposite forces can exist in harmony, we help
              organisations hold space for both vulnerability and strength,
              stability and evolution, introspection and bold action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we stand alongside leaders and teams who believe that
              culture should be their greatest advantage and not their biggest
              blind spot. Through a thoughtfully designed culture compass,
              YinYang weaves together evidence based tools and facilitation that
              brings real conversations to life. Whether we’re co-creating a
              leadership journey, redesigning how you work, or guiding you
              through complex change, our purpose stays the same: to make your
              workplace more conscious, connected, and alive; so your people and
              your business can thrive side by side.

            </div>
            <p>
              Tanisha M Jain has always been drawn to what sits beneath the
              surface—what drives us, connects us, and helps us thrive not just
              as individuals, but as teams and systems. That curiosity has taken
              her across strikingly different rooms: from coaching military
              leaders in the U.S. Army to guiding the culture strategy of the
              world’s first LGBTQ credit union. From the boardrooms of Fortune
              50 companies like Nike and Amazon to grassroots spaces redefining
              what leadership can look like.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through it all, one insight kept returning: when we focus only on
              performance, results may follow—but they rarely sustain. The real
              transformation happens when organizations stop trimming the
              branches and start tending to the roots. This became the seed of
              YinYang Leadership—a practice rooted in the belief that culture is
              not soft, nor secondary. It is the invisible force that determines
              whether people grow or burn out, whether strategy lands or floats.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tanisha is an ICF-certified coach and Columbia University graduate
              who blends over a decade of experience in leadership development
              with a lifelong exploration of Eastern wisdom and Western science.
              She integrates systems thinking, somatic practices, and deep
              dialogue to create spaces where both people and performance can
              evolve—together.
            </p>
            <p>
              She founded YinYang Leadership not as a consultancy, but as a
              collaborative movement. One that brings together best-in-class
              subject matter experts in coaching, talent management, systems
              change, and organizational design—so that clients have a single,
              trusted space for all their people and culture needs, without
              one-size-fits-all solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the core of her work is a bold yet simple belief: when
              organizations lead from who they truly are—not just what they
              do—they unlock a kind of edge that no strategy slide can
              replicate. Culture becomes their differentiator. Their compass.
              And their most human advantage.
